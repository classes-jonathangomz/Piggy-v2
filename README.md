# Exam:
### Points to evaluate:
- [ ] Write a Smart Contract that store PiggyBanks following the next rules (_25%_):
  - A PiggyBank will be created by the user with only two fields:
    1. finishDate: The date when the PiggyBank will be broken*.
    3. balance: The amount of Ether inside the PiggyBank.

  - The funds only will be avaliable when the finishDate is pass.
  - Only the owner will be able to see his balance.
  - Everyone can add funds to PiggyBanks of others.
- [ ] Compile (_35%_)
- [ ] Tests (_35%_)
- [ ] Deploy (_5%_)

* Search for how to store a date in Solidity.

### How I'm going to qualify?
Every repository will have the the code that meets the requirements.

**After the deadline I'm gonna edit this file to let you know how much do you get from every point.**

| #| Point         | Qualification | Value |
|-:|-------------- |:-------------:|:-----:|
| 1| Code          |               | _25%_ |
| 2| Compilation   |               | _35%_ |
| 3| Tests         |               | _35%_ |
| 4| Deployment    |               | _5%_  |

### Why that percentaje?
- **Code**: The code is not easy part. You need to have the logic and understand the rules.
- **Compilation**: You can have good logic and write the code but if this doesn't **compile** it doesn't work.
- **Test**: Tests are essential to work with Smart Contracts (and general development) and you need to be able to write _**good tests**_.
- **Deploy**: The deployment, in this case, is the easiest point.

### **Bonus**

- [ ] Write a Smart Contract that generate a random number.
  - I doesn't care the range of the random number.
