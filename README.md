# Exam:
### Points to evaluate:
- [ ] Write a Smart Contract that store PiggyBanks following the next rules:
  - A PiggyBank will be created by the user with only three fields:
    a) finishDate: The date when the PiggyBank will be broken*.
    b) userAddress: The address of the user who is the owner.
    c) balance: The amount of Ether inside the PiggyBank.

  - The funds only will be avaliable when the finishDate is pass.
  - Only the owner will be able to see his balance.
  - Everyone can add funds to PiggyBanks of others, but only if the receiver have a PiggyBank created.

* Search for how to store a date in Solidity.

- [ ] Compile
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Deploy

### How I'm going to verify?
Every repository will have the the code that meets the requirements.

### **Bonus**

- [ ] Write a Smart Contract that generate a random number.
  - I doesn't care the range of the random number.
